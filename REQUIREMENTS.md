# Requirements for the project. Suitcase e-shop: Multi-page online store.

## Goal:
Your task is to create a fully responsive, multi-page e-commerce website based on a provided Figma design template. This project challenges you to implement advanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts. You are required to avoid using JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Angular) or CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap). The task is quite complex and may take approximately **40 hours**.

## Data and assets:
- Follow the Figma design template, but perfect-pixel accuracy isn't required.
- The data for the application is provided in JSON format (`src/assets/data.json` file).

## Website structure:
The website should include key pages such as:

- **Homepage** with featured products in a carousel and highlighted categories.
- **Catalog** page with filtering, sorting, and pagination features.
- Single **Product Details** page providing detailed information about a selected product.
- **About Us** page containing details about the company and its team members
- **Contact Us** page with a functional form.
- **Cart** page where users can add, update, or remove products.

You will use the Figma template as the single source of truth for your design. Align the website's structure, styles, and components with the design specifications provided.


## Stages to implement the project:
The stages you will go through as you complete the project – as well as the requirements for each stage – are described below. Carefully review all the theoretical information for each stage before starting the project.

### **Stage 1.** Setting up the project
Start by creating a Git repository in `autocode.git.epam.com`. Click the "Start" button to fork a predefined template into your project space. Then, complete the following steps to set up your project:
- Clone the repository locally, then run `npm install` inside it to install dependencies from package.json.
- Add Sass into your project and implement a `compile` script to the package.json file to handle the compilation of all .scss files into .css files. If you’re unfamiliar with how to compile .scss files into .css, please refer to the [guide](https://sass-lang.com/guide/).
- Add a description to a `README.md` file. It should contain clear instructions on how to set up and run your project, including prerequisites (e.g., `npm install` and Sass compilation process).

### **Stage 2.** Implementing the layout (HTML + CSS)
Begin building the layout for each page based on the Figma template. Follow these guidelines:
- Create semantic HTML markup using tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, etc., for structured content organization.
- Implement styles using Sass: utilize mixins, variables, and Sass inheritance to simplify and organize styles.
- Use Flexbox and / or CSS Grid for advanced layouts.
- Style global components (e.g., buttons, input fields, links) and reusable elements with Sass by using organized partial files (`_buttons.scss`, `_forms.scss`, etc.).
- Ensure the design remains consistent with the Figma mockup for typography, spacing, and colors.


### **Stage 3.** Responsive Design
**Goal**: Ensure the website works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

**Requirements**:
- Use breakpoints (defaults: 768px, 1024px, 1440px).
- No horizontal scrolling at any resolution.
- Maintain readable font sizes and comfortable spacing at all breakpoints.
- Layouts must work in portrait and landscape orientations.
- Test cross-browser compatibility (at least in Chrome and Firefox).
- Images and videos must be responsive and maintain aspect ratio.
- Ensure navigation adapts for mobile (hamburger menu or equivalent).

### **Stage 4.** Interactivity & Functionality (JavaScript)
**General Features:**

**Final notes**:
- Ensure your web application combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript smoothly for a functional and engaging user experience.
- Test your application on multiple browsers and devices to ensure it works properly and looks good everywhere.
- Write clean, well-organized code that is easy to maintain and reuse.
- Avoid “magic numbers” — use CSS variables for colors, spacing, breakpoints.



### **Stage 5.** Project compilation, verification and submission
Once your project is complete, take the following steps to ensure quality and submit it for evaluation:

**Quality control**:
- Add linters: Set up ESLint for JavaScript and Stylelint for Sass/CSS to maintain consistent code quality and style.
- Linting script: Add a `lint` script to your package.json to check both `.js` and `.scss` files for issues. Fix any problems detected.

**Verification**:
- Verify that your project is fully functional. Projects that are not running or functional will not be evaluated.
- Push all changes to the remote repository and ensure everything is up to date, including configurations, scripts, and the `README.md` file.
- Double-check that the date of your last commit does not exceed the project deadline.

**Submitting your project**:
- Commit all your changes and ensure they are present in the remote repository.
- Submit the project before the deadline.
- Wait for your evaluation score.
